# Terraform OpenSearch Module

This module creates an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collection optimized for vector search operations. OpenSearch Serverless automatically provisions and scales the underlying resources to deliver fast data ingestion and millisecond query response times.

## Vector Collection

This module creates an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collection configured for VECTORSEARCH. It creates default encryption, network, and data policies for use with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. For encryption, it uses the default AWS owned KMS key. It allows network connections from the public internet, but access is restricted to specific IAM principals.

## Access Control

Access to the collection is secured through:

- IAM-based authentication
- Data access policies
- Network policies
- Encryption policies

## Vector Index

This module also supports the creation of a vector index. The vector index resource connects to OpenSearch and creates an index suitable for use with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. You can create a vector index by setting the input variable `create_vector_index` to `true`. You can pass in values for the `index_knn_algo_param_ef_search` and the `vector_index_mappings` or you can leave the default values.
